# Musitelligence

A Music project to generate and manipulate music using music theory and math.

## Scales:

Major scale 		= 	W-W-H-W-W-W-H	=	[2-2-1-2-2-2-1]\
Natuaral Minor scale 	= 	W-H-W-W-H-W-W	=	[2-1-2-2-1-2-2]\
Harmonic Minor scale 	= 	W-H-W-W-H-WH-H  =	[2-1-2-2-1-3-1]\
Melodic Minor scale 	= 	W-H-W-W-W-W-H 	=	[2-1-2-2-2-2-1]\
